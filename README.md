Rate Limiter — Django + React
A full-stack rate limiting system. Django + Redis handle the actual sliding-window enforcement; React is a control-panel style client that fires live requests at the API and reads back the rate-limit headers in real time.

How it works
Backend: sliding-window rate limiting via Redis Sorted Sets + an atomic Lua script. Plan-based limits (FREE/PRO/ENTERPRISE) with route-specific overrides. Exposes /health, /check, /metrics, and demo protected routes /login, /posts, /profile.
Frontend: a control-panel UI where you set an identity (user ID + plan), fire requests at any route, and watch the live readout — every response includes X-RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset headers which the UI renders directly.
See backend/ for the full API details (rate limit table, algorithm explanation, deployment notes).

Running locally
You need two terminals (backend + frontend) and Redis running.

1. Start Redis

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
2. Backend

cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
Runs on http://localhost:8000.

3. Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Runs on http://localhost:5173. The Vite dev server proxies /login, /posts, /profile, /health, /check, /metrics straight to localhost:8000, so there's no CORS friction in dev — just open http://localhost:5173 and start firing requests.

Production
The two halves deploy independently:

Backend → Render (free tier) + Redis Cloud (free tier). See backend/README.md for the step-by-step.
Frontend → Vercel or Netlify (both free for static sites). Set the build command to npm run build, output directory to dist, and add an environment variable VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com so the built app calls your live backend instead of localhost.
Also set CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS on the backend to your deployed frontend's URL (e.g. https://your-app.vercel.app), since in production the frontend and backend live on different domains and the Vite proxy no longer applies.
